# LTspiceGraphingApp
This project is for formatting the output data from LTspice into much more
readable plots better for presentation and analysis.

LTspice alows you to simulate circuit designs and it is frequently helpful
to look at the voltage and current values its simulations can produce.
The default LTspice plotter has a black background, single pixel thick 
lines as well as a very old design style. LTspice can also output the 
simulation data into a .txt file easily reconisable by MatLab. Once in 
MatLab all atributes of the plot can be controlled and the simple GUI this 
program provides makes it fast to plot simple data.
